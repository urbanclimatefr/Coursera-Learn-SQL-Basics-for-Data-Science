-- AB Testing Final Assignment
-- We are running an experiment at an item-level, which means all users who visit 
-- will see the same page, but the layout of different item pages may differ.

-- Compare this table to the assignment events we captured for user_level_testing.
-- Does this table have everything you need to compute metrics like 30-day view-binary?
-- Answer is No. The created_at date is needed.

SELECT *

-- Write a query and table creation statement to make final_assignments_qa 
-- look like the final_assignments table. If you discovered something missing 
-- in part 1, you may fill in the value with a place holder of the appropriate 
-- data type.
