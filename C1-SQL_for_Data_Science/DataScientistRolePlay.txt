Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that 
will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this 
first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your 
findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on 
how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where 
necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences 
and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be 
required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, 
you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting 
and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions 
you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where
indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able 
to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) 
to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout
application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact
for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
		SELECT COUNT(*)
		FROM table
	
	i. 		Attribute table = 10000
	ii. 	Business table = 10000
	iii. 	Category table = 10000
	iv. 	Checkin table = 10000
	v. 		elite_years table = 10000 
	vi. 	friend table = 10000
	vii. 	hours table = 10000
	viii. 	photo table = 10000
	ix. 	review table = 10000
	x. 		tip table = 10000
	xi. 	user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total number of distinct records for each of the keys listed below:

		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(key))
		FROM table

	i. 		Business = id: 10000
	ii. 	Hours = business_id: 1562
	iii. 	Category = business_id: 2643
	iv. 	Attribute = business_id: 1115
	v. 		Review = id:10000, business_id: 8090, user_id: 9581
	vi. 	Checkin = business_id: 493
	vii. 	Photo = id: 10000, business_id: 6493
	viii. 	Tip = user_id: 537, business_id: 3979
	ix. 	User = id: 10000
	x. 		Friend = user_id: 11
	xi. 	Elite_years = user_id: 2780
	


3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: "no"
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
		SELECT COUNT(*)
		FROM user
		WHERE id IS NULL OR 
		  name IS NULL OR 
		  review_count IS NULL OR 
		  yelping_since IS NULL OR
		  useful IS NULL OR 
		  funny IS NULL OR 
		  cool IS NULL OR 
		  fans IS NULL OR 
		  average_stars IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_hot IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_more IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_profile IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_cute IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_list IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_note IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_plain IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_cool IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_funny IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_writer IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_photos IS NULL 
	

	
4. Find the minimum, maximum, and average value for the following fields:

		SELECT AVG(column)
		FROM table

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1 		max: 5		avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min: 0		max: 2		avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min: 1		max: 53		avg: 1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min: 0		max: 2000		avg: 24.2995
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
		SELECT city,
			   SUM(review_count) AS reviews
		FROM business
		GROUP BY city
		ORDER BY reviews DESC
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans? 

		Yes, but also the amount of time that they have been yelping. The longer they 
		have been yelping and the more reviews they give has a higher fan count.

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
		SELECT id,
			   name,
			   review_count,
			   fans,

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
		
		Yes, but there does seem to be one major outlier, number three Harald. The
		other users seem to have a correlation with more `useful` and `funny`
		results in more fans, but also in conjunction with review_count and time
		they have been yelping.
	
	

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. 	Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city
	or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to 
	the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
	
	i.	Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	
			The 4-5 star group seems to have shorter hours then the 2-3 star group.
			Please note the query returned only three businesses so not a great 
			sample size.
	
	ii.	Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
	
		Yes and no, one of the 4-5 star group has a lot more reviews but then the other
		4-5 star group has close to the same number of reviews as the 2-3 star group
	
	iii.	Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two
		groups? Explain.

		No, every business is in a different zip-code.

	SQL code used for analysis:
	
		SELECT B.name,
			   B.review_count,
			   H.hours,
			   postal_code,
			   CASE
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%monday%" THEN 1
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%tuesday%" THEN 2
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%wednesday%" THEN 3
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%thursday%" THEN 4
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%friday%" THEN 5
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%saturday%" THEN 6
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%sunday%" THEN 7
			   END AS ord,
			   CASE
				  WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
				  WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
			   END AS star_rating
		FROM business B INNER JOIN hours H
		ON B.id = H.business_id
		INNER JOIN category C
		ON C.business_id = B.id
		WHERE (B.city == 'Las Vegas'
		AND
		C.category LIKE 'shopping')
		AND
		(B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3
		OR
		B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5)
		GROUP BY stars,ord
		ORDER BY ord,star_rating ASC

		
		
2.	Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What
	differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are
	closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your
	answer.
		
	i. 	Difference 1:
	
		The businesses that are open tend to have more reviews than ones that
		are closed on average.
		
			Open:   AVG(review_count) = 31.757
			Closed: AVG(review_count0 = 23.198
	
	
	ii.	Difference 2:
	
		The average star rating is higher for businesses that are open than
		businesses that are closed.
	
			Open:   AVG(stars) = 3.679
			Closed: AVG(stars) = 3.520
	
	
	SQL code used for analysis:
	
		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)),
			   AVG(review_count),
			   SUM(review_count),
			   AVG(stars),
			   is_open
		FROM business
		GROUP BY is_open

	
	
3. 	For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you
	want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.
	
	Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment 
	analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, 
	predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a 
	user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel 
	free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide
	answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
	i. 	Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
	
		Predicting whether a business will stay open or close. We wish not to explicitly
		examine the text of the reviews, but this would be an interesting analysis.
	
	ii.	Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis
		and why you chose that data:
		
		To better help businesses understand the importance of different factors which
		will help their business stay open. Some data that may be important; number of
		reviews, star rating of business, hours open, and of course location location
		location. We will gather the latitude and longitude as well as city, state, 
		postal_code, and address to make processing easier later on. Categories and 
		attributes will be used to better distinguish between different types of 
		businesses. `is_open` will determine which business is open and which business 
		have closed (not hours) but permanently.
		
	iii.	Output of your finished dataset:
