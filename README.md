# Learn SQL Basics for Data Science Specialization

This repository contains the materials to "Learn SQL Basics for Data Science", a specialization provided by University of California, Davis through Coursera.

This Specialization is intended for a learner with no previous coding experience seeking to develop SQL query fluency. Through four progressively more difficult SQL projects with data science applications, you will cover topics such as SQL basics, data wrangling, SQL analysis, AB testing, distributed computing using Apache Spark, and more. These topics will prepare you to apply SQL creatively to analyze and explore data; demonstrate efficiency in writing queries; create data analysis datasets; conduct feature engineering, use SQL with other data analysis and machine learning toolsets; and use SQL with unstructured data sets. 

* Course 1: SQL for Data Science
* Course 2: Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing with SQL
* Course 3: Distributed Computing with Spark SQL
* Course 4: SQL for Data Science Capstone Project
